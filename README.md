# Financial Data Analysis & AI-Powered Financial Chatbot ðŸ’¬ðŸ“Š
This repository contains two key projects: financial data analysis from 10-K filings and the development of an AI-powered chatbot built using Python and Flask. The chatbot allows users to interact with financial data dynamically and retrieve meaningful insights.
# Project Overview
# 1. Task 1: Financial Data Extraction & Analysis
In this project, I manually extracted and analyzed financial data from the 10-K filings of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple for the last three fiscal years. The extracted data includes:

Total Revenue
Net Income
Total Assets
Total Liabilities
Cash Flow from Operating Activities
# Key Steps:
Extracted financial data from the SEC EDGAR database.
Cleaned and structured the data using pandas for further analysis.
Performed year-over-year growth calculations and trend analysis.
Visualized the financial data using matplotlib for clear insights.

# 2. Task 2: AI-Powered Financial Chatbot
This task involves building a financial chatbot using Flask to provide users with financial insights based on the analysis from Task 1. The chatbot can answer predefined queries such as:

"What is the total revenue?"
"What is the revenue growth (%)?"
"What is the net income growth (%)?"
# Key Features:
Flask-based Web Interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a simple web UI.
Predefined Queries: The chatbot responds to predefined queries by fetching financial data from Task 1.
Dynamic Response Generation: The chatbot uses logic to compute and present year-over-year growth rates and other financial metrics.

# Tech Stack
Python 
Pandas
Flask
Jupyter Notebook
HTML/CSS (for Flask-based UI)
matplotlib (for data visualization)

# Future Improvements
Incorporating machine learning models to allow more flexible, conversational user queries.
Enhancing the chatbotâ€™s ability to handle more complex financial queries beyond predefined ones.
Adding more dynamic data visualizations based on user queries.
